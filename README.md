# Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm With javascript
A* (pronounced "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes". It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. [( Read More ... )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

## Getting Started
We tried to implement this routing algorithm through javascript in this project.

In this project we try to implement routing in any desired directional graph, and along with finding the path, we will show how to select the path for the training of the algorithm.
